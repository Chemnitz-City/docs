# Issue: Missing yarn resource

1. Download the `yarn` resource from [cfx-server-data](https://github.com/bitpredator/cfx-server-data/tree/master/resources/%5Bsystem%5D/%5Bbuilders%5D)

2. Place the `yarn` resource in your `resources` folder.

3. Add `ensure yarn` to your `server.cfg` file (it should be before `ensure ws_server`).
