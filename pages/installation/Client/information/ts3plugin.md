# Issue: .ts3_plugin is an unknown file

If you can't open a .ts3_plugin file or it tries to open it with another program that isnt TeamSpeak 3, follow these steps.

1. Right click the *.ts3_plugin file

2. `Open with...` or `Open with` > `Choose another app`

3. `More apps` > `Look for antoher app on this PC` (at the botton)

4. Go to your TS installation path.

The default paths are:
- `C:\Program Files\TeamSpeak 3 Client` for 64-bit Installations
- `C:\Program Files (x86)\TeamSpeak 3 Client` for 32-bit Installations

5. Select the `package_inst.exe`

You can now open the .ts3_plugin file by double clicking it.
